Missing Originals: No ancient manuscript of Ptolemy's Geographia has survived with original maps drawn during his lifetime. Later Visual Representations: The visual \"Ptolemy maps\" we see today are reconstructions created centuries later, primarily starting with Byzantine scribes around the turn of the 13th to 14th century, who followed his meticulous instructions for map construction. These later copies were often drawn by non-specialist scribes and varied in accuracy due to repeated copying.
