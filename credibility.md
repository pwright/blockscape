- Adoption and Production Use: What specific, verifiable production use cases or case studies are available from non-Red Hat organizations that demonstrate Skupper's reliability, scalability, and performance in complex, hybrid-cloud, or multi-cluster environments?
- Security Audit and Vulnerability Management: Has Skupper undergone any independent third-party security audits or penetration testing, and what is the project's formal process and track record for disclosing and patching critical security vulnerabilities (CVEs)?
- Community Engagement and Contributor Diversity: Beyond its primary affiliation (Red Hat), what is the size, activity level, and geographic and organizational diversity of the open-source contributor community (e.g., commit frequency from non-affiliated individuals, number of active maintainers from different companies)?
- Long-Term Support and Interoperability: What is the long-term support (LTS) plan for major Skupper versions, and what assurances are provided for backward compatibility and interoperability during version upgrades, particularly between major releases like v1 and v2?
- Performance Benchmarks: Are there publicly available, objective performance benchmark reports (e.g., latency, throughput, CPU/memory overhead) that compare Skupper against other leading multi-cluster connectivity or service mesh solutions in common application networking scenarios?
