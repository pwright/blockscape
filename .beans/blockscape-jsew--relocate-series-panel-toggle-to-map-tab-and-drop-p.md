Move series panel hide/show control into the map tab (beside Dark mode), ensure it defaults to visible on each map load, and remove persistence/localStorage.

## Checklist
- [x] Move the hide/show control into the map tab next to Dark mode.
- [x] Reset the control to visible whenever a new map loads (no persistence).
- [x] Remove localStorage/settings persistence for series panel visibility.
