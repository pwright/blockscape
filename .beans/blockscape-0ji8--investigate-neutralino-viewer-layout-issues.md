Check why Neutralino map-only viewer shows full UI and appears off. Determine if fix possible via Neutralino config or requires HTML/CSS change.

## Checklist
- [x] Inspect viewer HTML and mount flow for Neutralino
- [x] Check Svelte features flags that control header/sidebar
- [x] Provide fix recommendation
