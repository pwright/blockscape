Address Obsidian plugin gaps: saving a series should preserve all maps, add a header visibility option, and persist viewer settings within Obsidian.

## Checklist
- [x] Make Save to note preserve series data instead of only the active map.
- [x] Add a header visibility option (stored per user) in Obsidian viewer.
- [x] Persist Blockscape viewer settings via plugin storage for Obsidian.
