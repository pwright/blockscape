# Moving items on the map

Use keyboard or drag-and-drop to reposition components without breaking flow.

- Arrow keys move selection; `Shift+←/→` reorders inside a category; `Shift+↑/↓` moves between categories.
- Drag items to regroup or adjust maturity; watch dependencies to keep layout consistent.
- Use undo in your browser if you drop something in the wrong place.
