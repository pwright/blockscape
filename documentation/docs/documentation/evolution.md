# Evolution and maturity (x-axis)

Items flow left-to-right to show maturity: left is novel/custom, right is commodity/standard. This makes strategy discussions concrete—move right when something stabilizes; move left for experiments.

- Start new ideas on the left; shift right as they become repeatable.
- Avoid overcrowding: combine highly similar items.
- Use dependencies to clarify why a left item cannot move without its supports.
