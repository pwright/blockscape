# Visible value chain (y-axis)

Categories stack top-to-bottom to show how visible a component is to end users. Higher rows are more obvious; lower rows are the supporting plumbing.

- Put user-facing outcomes at the top and infrastructure toward the bottom.
- Keep names short so the vertical ordering stays scannable.
- Move categories if the conversation shows they belong higher or lower.
