# Relations and dependencies

Dependencies make the map useful: selecting a tile highlights what it relies on. Keep them accurate so impact and risk discussions are grounded.

- Connect each item to the components it truly needs; avoid “everything depends on everything.”
- Use the preview panel (right-click) to inspect dependencies quickly.
- When the structure changes, revisit links so the map keeps its integrity.
