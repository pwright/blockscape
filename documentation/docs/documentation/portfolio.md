# Portfolio of models

Keep multiple maps together to show change over time or compare viewpoints.

- Use a series (`.bs` array) for side-by-side versions.
- Host collections in Apicurio or the optional local backend so teams can browse and fetch models centrally.
- Name models and abstracts clearly so readers can jump to the right map.
