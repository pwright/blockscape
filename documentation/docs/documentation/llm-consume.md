# LLM consumes BS

LLMs can interpret maps you generate. Give the model a `.bs` file and ask for summaries, risks, or alternative evolutions.

- Provide the raw JSON and request structured outputs (e.g., “list risky dependencies”).
- Keep IDs and abstracts meaningful; they guide the model’s explanation quality.
- Pair with the **LLM generates BS** prompt for fast iteration loops.
