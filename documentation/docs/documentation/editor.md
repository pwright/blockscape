# Editing maps

Toggle **Edit** to open the JSON editor alongside the map. Changes you save are reflected immediately.

- CRUD: add/remove categories and items, tweak IDs/names, and update dependencies.
- Reorder with drag-and-drop or the move up/down buttons; both mirror the keyboard shortcuts on the map.
- Click **Validate** before saving to catch schema issues early.
