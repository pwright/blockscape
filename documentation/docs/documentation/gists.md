# Gist-powered sharing

Blockscape can load models from GitHub Gists so you can keep maps versioned and shareable.

- Create a Gist containing a `.bs` file (single model or series).
- Load it via the UI’s Gist field or by appending the Gist URL/token to the query string.
- Use this for lightweight collaboration without standing up a backend.

See also: the **Share links** page for encoded URLs when a Gist is not an option.
