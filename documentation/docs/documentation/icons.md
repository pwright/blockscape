# Icons and logos

Maps can display small logos on tiles to hint at technology choices or brands.

- Add a `logo` field with a path or URL (SVG, PNG, GIF are fine).
- Keep icons simple so they do not overwhelm the grid; text still leads.
- Store shared assets in `logos/` and reference them with relative paths.
