# Visualising to understand

Gestalt is about perceiving the whole rather than isolated parts—patterns, relationships, and context matter more than individual tiles. Blockscape leans on this: the map format emphasizes relationships and evolution so teams share the same mental model before debating solutions.

- Show component categories top-to-bottom to reflect visibility/value.
- Place components/items left-to-right to express maturity (novel → commodity).
- Short abstracts that define the domain, not components. Dependencies and positioning stay readable.
